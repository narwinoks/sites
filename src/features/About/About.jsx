          Hi there! My name is Winarno, usually called Win. I'm currently 19
          years old and was born in Karanganyar, Central Java, Indonesia. I
          graduated from VHS 2 Karanganyar in 2021 as a Software Engineering
          student. My journey in web development started in 2019 when I began
          learning PHP. Over time, I've shifted my focus to explore web
          development further, particularly with JavaScript, PHP, and Laravel
          Framework.
